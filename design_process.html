        <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
        <p>Middle and high school students seeking mental health support through Sonar Mental Health face challenges with the 
            onboarding process, leading to low engagement and retention; as part of our mission, we aim to research and redesign
             the onboarding experience to improve user engagement and long-term retention.</p>

        <h2>Study Purpose</h2>
        <p>Sonar Mental Health has been having trouble keeping and expanding their user population. Users love that
            their platform offers an empathetic solution for teens, but keeping users coming back to use Sonar's 
            messaging feature is a significant challenge. So, they recruited us, the students of IN4MATX 172, to help 
            them create features and experiences in Sonar's platform to improve first-time user experience and 
            increase student retention.

        <p><b>Aspects Designed For:</b> We designed for a 15 year-old who lacks motivation, time management skills, and social skills. Her 
            frustrations are addressed in our app by being able to develop better habits and skills through talking with a mental health 
            companion.

        <p><b>Aspects Designed For:</b> We designed for a 17-year-old who is very empathetic, but lacks resilience. She has anxiety, so she 
            turns to Sonny for a safe space and to gain strategies for coping. Her frustrations can be addressed by choosing a texting 
            style that meets her needs, such as "Advice & Support" or "Uplifting & Positive" to get matched with a mental health 
            companion who is more specialized toward anxiety patients.

        <p>We conducted 2 rounds of interviews of 7 students aged 13 - 18 years old. 
            In the first interview, we showed them our Prototype #1 and compared it to Sonar's design.
            In the second interview, we showed them our Prototype #2 and compared it to Sonar's design again.

        <p>We designed our first prototype in attempt to be as simple and straightforward as possible for the student.
            We used a texting style to emulate how a student could type their responses in the mobile app, which then 
            gives them prompts to the next question.

        <p>Our second prototypes looked more like Sonar's original design, but we also included a few screens explaining how Sonar worked, 
            a data privacy policy, and more intuitive and personalization features. We made sure to clarify Sonar's human-in-the-loop 
        model so students know all messages are read and written by humans. Also, we created a more intuitive text-box as well as mood slider.
     For personalization, we devised more texting styles and the option for "No preference" and the ability to change Sonny's user 
    profile picture and name by uploading a photo.</p>

        </div>
        <p>Finally, we made tweaks to our second prototypes by making font size larger and bolder, changing the upload profile picture picture to selecting 
            a premade profile picture, and integrating the screens about how Sonar works into the flow in a digestible way.
