        Most young people do not turn to traditional mental health solutions due 
        to stigma, cost, and fear of talking to someone they don’t know (Radez et al., 2021). 
        Sonar Mental Health, a preventative solution for middle school and high school 
        students seeking mental health support, aims to meet the needs of these young people.
        Sonar provides the student with a friendly approachable chatbot using AI and real 
        certified peer counselors, ensuring students feel seen and supported. Our team, Group 11, is 
        collaborating with Sonar Mental Health to create their first iOS mobile app designs, 
        with an improved onboarding process, and improving their overall student user retention rates.

        <strong>Problem Statement:</strong> 
        <br>
        <br>
        Middle and high school students seeking 
        mental health support through Sonar Mental Health face challenges 
        with the onboarding process, leading to low engagement and retention; as part 
        of our mission, we aim to research and redesign the onboarding experience
         to improve user engagement and long-term retention.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Goals:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Improve the onboarding process, keeping the target audience, students ages 13 to 18, in mind</li>
            <li>Enhance student user retention by adding experiences and features that keep the student coming back</li>
          </ul>
